This project involves the development and evaluation of a machine learning model for predicting credit
card defaults. The primary objective of this project is to help a bank reduce its credit card default rate and
improve its risk management strategy. The model takes into account several features such as the
customer's credit history, payment history, outstanding balances, and other factors that contribute to credit
card defaults which has been provided
The model's potential applications are diverse and numerous, including developing targeted marketing
strategies, offering personalized credit limits, improving risk management, and even identifying
potentially fraudulent activities. The report also conducts feature engineering to encode the dataset for use
in different machine learning models and techniques such as Random Forest, KNN and ANN.
